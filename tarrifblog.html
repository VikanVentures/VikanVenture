  <h2>Trump’s 2025 Tariff Strategy: Key Events and Market Impact (Updated to April 11)</h2>
  <p>In 2025, Donald Trump’s return to global trade policy brought sweeping tariffs that reshaped markets and strained international relations. His aggressive moves triggered global uncertainty, market volatility, and supply chain disruption.</p>

  <h3>Timeline of Major Events</h3>

  <h3>1. January 17, 2025 – Global Tariff Proposal</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>10% tariff on all U.S. imports</li>
    <li>25% on Canadian/Mexican imports (unless border reforms)</li>
    <li>50% on Chinese goods</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Impact:</strong> World Bank warned of global slowdown; investor anxiety surged.</p>

  <h3>2. February 4, 2025 – Tariffs on Canada/Mexico Enforced</h3>
  <p>Canada and Mexico retaliated with their own tariffs. U.S. sectors relying on NAFTA supply chains saw sharp disruptions.</p>

  <h3>3. March 4, 2025 – Tariffs Resume After Brief Pause</h3>
  <p>After a 30-day pause, tariffs were reinstated due to stalled border talks. The EU voiced concern over a broadening trade conflict.</p>

  <h3>4. March 24, 2025 – Tariffs on Venezuela-Linked Countries</h3>
  <p>Trump imposed 25% tariffs on countries importing Venezuelan oil. Oil prices rose, and tensions with European allies intensified.</p>

  <h3>5. April 2, 2025 – "Liberation Day" Two-Tier Tariff System</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>10% base tariff on all imports</li>
    <li>60% on imports from 60 "unfair trading" countries</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Shock:</strong> Global markets reeled from announcement.</p>

  <h3>6. April 9, 2025 – 104% Tariff on Chinese Imports</h3>
  <p>China responded by devaluing its currency and retaliating with tariffs on U.S. goods. American farmers were especially affected.</p>

  <h3>7. April 10, 2025 – Trump Threatens Extra 50% on China</h3>
  <p>Total U.S. tariffs on China could exceed 115%. China vowed to "fight to the end" and warned of additional countermeasures.</p>

  <h3>8. April 11, 2025 – Tariff Pause Hinted Amid Market Turmoil</h3>
  <p>The White House signaled a potential short-term pause on further tariff hikes. This prompted a brief rebound across major stock indices, though volatility remained high.</p>

  <h3>Market & Economic Impact</h3>

  <h3>1. Stocks</h3>
  <p>The S&P 500 dropped approximately 9% from January to April. Technology and automotive sectors were hit hardest due to global supply dependencies.</p>

  <h3>2. Inflation</h3>
  <p>Consumer prices surged as import costs rose. Electronics, clothing, and food saw significant price increases.</p>

  <h3>3. Supply Chains</h3>
  <p>Massive disruptions occurred, especially in the electronics, auto, and agricultural industries. Companies scrambled to reroute supply chains to countries like Vietnam, India, and Mexico.</p>

  <h3>4. Global Alliances</h3>
  <p>Countries impacted by U.S. tariffs began forming new trade partnerships. The EU, China, and others strengthened economic ties to reduce U.S. dependency.</p>

  <h3>5. Growth Outlook</h3>
  <p>The World Bank revised its global economic forecast downward by 0.3%, and the U.S. growth forecast was reduced by 0.9% due to the escalating trade war.</p>

  <h3>Conclusion</h3>
  <p>Trump’s tariff strategy has redrawn global trade lines, triggering inflation, disrupting supply chains, and heightening market uncertainty. As tensions mount, any further escalation—or pause—will continue to drive market behavior in the months ahead.</p>
